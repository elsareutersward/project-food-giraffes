# Food Review website ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘

The aim of this project was to build a restaurant listing page based on the Zomato API. The project was done in a team of 8, with the goal to build a food review website of Japanese couisine in London, UK. 

## The problem 

The focus of the project was to practice working as a team on a project using GitHub. Before starting the project the team sketched out a draft of how the page should look and what to include. The group than split into smaller groups each responsible for a functionality of the page (sorting of price and rating) and one group responsible for styling. The group set up a developer branch with the content both team needed to use and then added a branch for each group to code in. During the build the groups shifted team mates on a regular to exchange knowledge and solve problems. Upon completion of the branches, the team merged everything and practiced on how to debug JavaScript.
